<h1>Conditionals</h1>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Write a program that prompts the user to input three grades, one for math, one for science, and one for history.  Your program should calculate the average of the three grades to one decimal point and give the user the following feedback.  If their average is greater than 90, "First Honors", between between 85 and 90, "Second Honors", less than 85 but greater than or equal to 80, "Third Honors", and less than 80, "Not good enough!"</p>
<pre><code> jharvard@run.cs50.net (~): ./conditionals<br /> Enter your math grade: 90<br/>Enter your science grade: 80<br/>Enter your history grade: 85<br/>Average: 85.0<br>
